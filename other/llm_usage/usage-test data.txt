Read the data, write 20 test using R, meet the requirement Tests
High-quality extensive suites of tests are written for the both the simulated and actual datasets. These suites must be in separate scripts. The suite should be extensive and put together in a sophisticated way using packages like testthat, validate, pointblank, or great expectations. You may use one package. 


ChatGPT
The dataset contains the following columns:

UHRSWORK: Weekly hours worked (numeric, range expected to be 0–168).
INCWAGE: Income from wages (numeric, non-negative).
region: Region (categorical, values: Northeast, South, West, Midwest).
education_level: Education level (categorical, values: High_School, Bachelors_or_Higher).
age: Age (numeric, range expected to be 18–100).
gender: Gender (categorical, values: Male, Female).
race_group: Race group (categorical, e.g., White, Black, Asian, Mixed_Other).
Here’s an extensive suite of 20 tests using the testthat package in R.

  # Test for logical consistency in income
  expect_true(all(simulated_data$INCWAGE > 0 | simulated_data$UHRSWORK == 0), "Non-working individuals have positive income.")

Explanation of Tests
Dataset Loading and Structure: Validates that the dataset is successfully loaded and structured correctly.
Column Types: Ensures that all columns have the expected data types.
Value Ranges: Checks that numeric columns are within valid ranges and categorical columns contain only valid categories.
Missing Values: Ensures no column has missing (NA) values.
Outliers and Consistency: Identifies outliers and verifies logical relationships between columns.
Running Tests
Place the test script in a folder (e.g., tests) and run it using testthat:

r
复制代码
library(testthat)
test_dir("tests")
This ensures a clean and robust validation of your dataset. Let me know if you need additional features or adaptations for your actual dataset! ​​

Explanation of the Tests
Structure Tests:

Dataset existence, non-zero dimensions, and expected column names.
Type Tests:

Ensure each column has the correct data type.
Range Tests:

Validate that numeric columns fall within expected ranges (e.g., UHRSWORK is between 0–168).
Category Tests:

Check that categorical columns contain only valid values (e.g., region, gender).
Logical Consistency:

Example: Minors should not work over 40 hours, and individuals with no work hours should have zero income.
How to Run the Tests
Save the script as test_simulated_data.R in a folder and use testthat to execute:

r
复制代码
library(testthat)
test_file("test_simulated_data.R")
This comprehensive test suite ensures the dataset's integrity and logical consistency. Let me know if you'd like further refinements!

── Error: Dataset structure and loading ────────────────────────────────────────
Error in expect_setequal(names(simulated_data), expected_columns, "Column names do not match expected names."): unused argument ("Column names do not match expected names.")

Error:
! Test failed
Backtrace:
    ▆
 1. ├─testthat::test_that(...)
 2. │ └─withr (local) <fn>()
 3. └─reporter$stop_if_needed()

ChatGPT

The error occurs because the expect_setequal function in testthat does not accept a custom failure message as its third argument. The correct syntax for expect_setequal does not include a custom error message.

Here’s the corrected line of code:

Corrected Code
r
复制代码
# Correct usage of expect_setequal
expect_setequal(names(simulated_data), expected_columns)
Revised Test Suite
Here’s the corrected section for testing the dataset structure:

r
复制代码
test_that("Dataset structure and loading", {
  # Test 1: Dataset exists
  expect_true(exists("simulated_data"), "Simulated data was not loaded.")
  
  # Test 2: Dataset is a data frame
  expect_true(is.data.frame(simulated_data), "Simulated data is not a data frame.")
  
  # Test 3: Dataset has non-zero rows and columns
  expect_gt(nrow(simulated_data), 0, "Dataset has no rows.")
  expect_gt(ncol(simulated_data), 0, "Dataset has no columns.")
  
  # Test 4: Dataset contains expected columns
  expected_columns <- c("UHRSWORK", "INCWAGE", "region", "education_level", "age", "gender", "race_group")
  expect_setequal(names(simulated_data), expected_columns)  # Removed custom error message
})
Explanation of Fix
expect_setequal Usage:

This function automatically generates an appropriate error message if the condition fails.
It does not support a custom error message as an additional argument.
Why It Fails:

Adding a custom error message causes a syntax error because the function doesn't expect this argument.

Explanation of Adjustments
Dataset Structure:

Verifies that analysis_data has the correct structure and contains the expected columns.
Data Types:

Checks if each column has the expected type (UHRSWORK, INCWAGE, and age are numeric; others are character).
Value Ranges and Categories:

Ensures values in UHRSWORK and INCWAGE are positive or non-negative.
Validates the age range (18–65).
Confirms categorical columns (region, education_level, gender, race_group) contain only valid categories.
Logical Consistency:

Ensures individuals with no working hours (UHRSWORK) have zero income.
Next Steps
Save the script and run the tests using:

r
复制代码
library(testthat)
test_file("test_analysis_data.R")
If any test fails, inspect the failing column using:

r
复制代码
unique(analysis_data$column_name)
